    <h1> The Nations </h1>
    <p>
        Each nation in the world of glowing blades has at least 1 major defining trait, that makes it easily identifiable. <br>
        This page is a brief guide to the world and its several nations. <br>
    </p>

    <!-- a brief description for each nation. -->
    <h3> THE EMPIRE </h3>
    <p>
        The Empire is the northernmost nation in this world, and is consequently, the coldest. <br>
        Even by comparison to the next-coldest climate (Greatland), the Empire's tundras and mountains are harsh. <br>
        Its people value strength above all else, and its current Empress has a bloody history behind her. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> GREATLAND </h3>
    <p>
        West of the Empire is Greatland, a current rival of and former state of the Empire.  <br>
        Greatlands people are very prideful, which resulted in a colonization of northern Westland, <br>
        allowing them to have some land that is actually well suited for farming. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> EASTLAND </h3>
    <p>
        East of the Empire is Eastland, with a relatively warmer climate, much more suited for farming. <br>
        They maintain relatively peaceful relations with the Empire and it's other neighbor, Borderland. <br>
        It too used to be a state of the Empire, however due to the mountain ridges, <br>
        it became increasingly difficult to govern, and so they were afforded their own independence.<br>
    </p>

    <h3> BORDERLAND </h3>
    <p>
        Borderland is a small tropical area, isolated by seas and mountains from the rest of the world. <br>
        Its people migrated from Northriver and Southriver, and quickly became one of the most praised nations for its music and dance. <br>
        They only really trade with Eastland, due to it being a relatively small trip to get between the two. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> WESTLAND </h3>
    <p>
        Westland is known to the rest of the world, as the Capital of Magical Progress. <br>
        Its cities bustling with innovation and magic at every corner, its people value magic above all other skills. <br>
        Its capital houses the most prestigious Magic Schools and several high rated MaMAr Dojos.  <br>
    </p>

    <h3> LOSTLAND </h3>
    <p>
        In the southwest there lies a canyon surrounded by mountains, this canyon houses Lostland.<br>
        Due to a lack of much direct sunlight, really only getting any at noon, the nations main food supply is mushrooms.<br>
        Their culture had begun to revolve around mushrooms, seeing them as a symbol for the cycle of life and death.<br>
    </p>

    <h3> HEARTLAND </h3>
    <p> 
        North of Lostland, and east of Westland is the Heartland, a somewhat tropical nation. <br>
        Due to its location, combined with its climate, it became the worlds #1 trade center.<br>
        With people from all over the world visiting, both for just trade, tourism, or to move in, it's become the most diverse nation. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> SOUTHWEST PLAINS </h3>
    <p>
        South of Heartland and East of Lostland is a large expanse of open flatlands, known as the Southwest Plains. <br>
        It's difficult to point out one prominant power within this nation, but all of the powers within it are in an alliance of sorts. <br>
        They do all trade with each other, giving what they have excess of and what the others need, <br>
        and they all are willing to fight for each other against outside nations. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> BRIDGELAND </h3>
    <p>
        A vast desert between the Grandpeaks and Southwest plains, with a canal between its two parts, the Bridgeland is relatively barren. <br>
        The nation relies heavily on imports and its few rivers for most of its sustainability, which also lead to its leading issue. <br>
        Bridgeland is littered with bandits, dunepirates, and the like, making the already treacherous journey around it even harder. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> GRANDPEAKS </h3>
    <p>
        The Grandpeaks is a large mountain ridge that seperates Northriver and Southriver from Bridgeland, which is the #1 export country for minerals.<br>
        Mining is the nations main and almost only export, but due to being a hotspot for catalysts, the main method of magic,<br>
        it is profiable enough to surivve entirely off of trade.<br>
    </p>

    <h3> NORTHRIVER </h3>
    <p>
        One of the two nations, seperated by a great river which flows between Grandpeaks and Borderland.<br>
        Northriver is the more swampy of the two, being largely marshes, especially closer to the coast, and rely more on fishing. <br>
        Between the two river nations, they are also the one that believes humans ability to use magic were a gift from the gods. <br> 
    </p>

    <h3> SOUTHRIVER </h3>
    <p>
        One of the two river nations, seperated by a great river which flows between Borderland and Grandpeaks.<br>
        Southriver is the more well rounded of the two, having a decent amount of plains suitable for farming.<br>
        Between the two river nations, they are the one that believes humans earned the ability to use magic to challenge the gods. <br>
